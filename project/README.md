# Management System User Stories

We chose **Fitness Center Management** but we quickly realized we needed something more general.  
We decided on **Management System** and created the following user stories:

## User Stories
- **As an administrator**, I want to add, update, or remove members so that I can keep membership records accurate and up to date.  
- **As a manager**, I want to view active, expired, and pending memberships so that I can monitor member engagement and retention.  
- **As an administrator**, I want to track and manage payments so that I can ensure memberships remain active and revenue is recorded.  

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system must allow the admin to add, update, or remove members.  
- The system must allow the admin to view active, expired, and pending memberships.  
- The system must allow the admin to track and manage payments.
